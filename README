Usage:

Pre-setup:
1.Extract contents of “script.pkg” in Worldoftanksdir/res/packages/scripts.pkg (you can use following: WinRAR or make an copy of script.pkg and rename to script.zip) directly to Worldoftanksdir/res/ folder.
For now it is crucial step in order to get tool working.

2. Get files from here "https://github.com/ztyzbb/WOT-Tank-Information-Creater/tree/master/Publish"
Following files:
"msgunfmt.exe"
"wottoolslib.exe"
"libintl-8.dll"
"libiconv-2.dll"
"libgettextsrc-0-19-7.dll"
"libgettextlib-0-19-7.dll"
"libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll"

3. put files with my application 

4. Run the tool (all output files will be at same location there executable was launched in separate folders)

it will generate:
>output proceeds .po
>>XMLoutput proceeds .xml
>>>JSONoutput generates .json

that being said,
Outputs multiple:
nation_vechiele.mo
nation_vechiele.xml
nation.json

while for example from Czech(.json) nation) :
{
        "Hidden": "false", // is tank not in game ? [from .xml files]
        "Type": "LT",      // lt for light tanks, mt medium tanks, ht heavy tanks, td tank destroyers , spg artillery [from .xml files]
        "codename": "Cz06_Kolohousenka", // [from .xml files] modified output before writing
        "description": "Cz06_Kolohousenka_descr", // [from .xml files]
        "nationId": "czech", // Nation name and .json file name, is set based on "caught" folder name
        "premium": "false",  // Does vehicle cost gold ? [from .xml files]
        "price": "0",	     // [from .xml files] if it is not premium set to true, then it cost in silver else in gold
        "shortUserString": "Cz06_Kolohousenka_short",  // [from .xml files]
        "tankid": "0",	// [from .xml files]  modified to tankid instead of id before writing
        "tier": "1",	// [from .xml files]  modified to tier instead of levels before writing
        "vehicle": "Kolohousenka" // [from .mo/.po files] reading string from codename and checking if codename exist in .mo/.po files if so pick up near name (msgir)
}
